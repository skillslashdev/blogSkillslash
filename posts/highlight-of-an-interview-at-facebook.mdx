Finally there are more 4-5 interviews which are conducted on site and each of these lasts for 45 minutes.

### Why are Facebook interviews unique?

- All these questions and the interview frame is the same for any level you are interviewing for regardless of your experience or educational background. This makes it a system-designed interview.
- Interviewers are paired in facebook during an interview on the basis of the positions they have held or with the directly working individuals with the position they are interviewing for. Thus, the interview here is structured.
- The five core values on the basis of which your abilities are evaluated at a facebook interview are: Move Fast, Be Bold, Focus on Impact, Be Open, and Build Social Value. Thus, your core values and behavior is tested.

Coming to to main topic of discussion,

Interleave list of lists in Java

Example:

input=[[1,2,3], [9,0], [5], [-4,-5,-2,-3,-1]];

output=[1,9,5,-4,2,0,-5,3,-2,-3,-1]

### Code using Python:

```Python
max = 3listofList = [[1, 2, 3], [9, 5], [-1], [12,90,3] ];
oplist =[];
for i in range(0,max):
  for list in listofList:
    if (i \< len(list)):oplist.append(list[i])print oplist |

```

## The code in Java using the same logic:

```Java
import java.util.\*;
import java.lang.\*;
import java.io.\*;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;
class Ideone{
  private static void interleaveLists(List\<List\<Integer\>\> ll){
    if(ll == null)return;int listLength = 0;
    int total = 0;
    for(List\<Integer\> list : ll){
      if(list == null)
      continue;
      listLength = Math.max(list.size(), listLength);
      total += list.size();
      }
      int[]
      result = new int[total];
      int index = 0;
      for(int i = 0; i \< listLength; ++i){
        for(List\<Integer\> list : ll){
          if(list == null)continue;
          if(i \< list.size()){
            result[index++] = list.get(i);System.out.println(list.get(i));
            }
          }
        }
      for( int x :result){
        System.out.println(x);
        }
        }
        public static \<Integer\> List\<Integer\> twoDArrayToList(int [][] twoDArray) {
          List list = new ArrayList();
          for (int [] array : twoDArray) {
            list.add(Arrays.asList(array));}return list;
          }
        public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception{
          int [][] arr = {{1, 2, 3}, {9, 0}, {5}, {-4, -5, -2, -3, -1,5,2}};
          List\<List\<Integer\>\> ll = twoDArrayToList(arr);interleaveLists(ll);
          }
      }
```
