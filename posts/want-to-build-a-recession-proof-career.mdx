## Introduction

We all believe that recession is a really scary word. Whether it is prevalent in the economy or will occur soon, it's certainly not an experience one would like to add to their list of experiences in life.

Usually, when people talk about recession, the discussion includes terms like layoffs, firing, job loss, etc. If you are in the job sector, how do you keep your job when there are talks of dismissal or termination?

Do you think your job is safe in times of economic downturns like a [**recession**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession)?

Although there is no such thing as assured employment, you can increase your chances of finding work in a down economy by acquiring and honing recession-proof skills.

## Recession: A Brief Introduction

The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) defines a recession as a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, visible as production, employment, and various other indicators.

Recession may also mean the period between when an economy is at its peak of economic activity and when it reaches its bottom. And, this occurs when there is an external trade shock, a natural disaster (large-scale), adverse supply shock, an economic bubble burst, or even a pandemic like COVID-19.

So, people with jobs need to develop skills that will withstand the wrath of hard times like a recession. We discuss the main ones below.

## Some Noteworthy Recession-Proof Job Skills

Whether the economy is booming or in a tailspin, we need to always be working to improve our skills so that we may advance in our chosen fields. Jobs aren't immune to economic downturns, but certain skills certainly are. Let's have a look at them:

1. **Transferable Skills**

Transferable abilities are the most valuable arsenal pieces you can have. These skill sets are highly transferable and applicable in a wide variety of jobs and organizations. Because they demonstrate your ability to complete a task or solve an issue without prior experience with the specific context in which you will be applying your skills, transferable skills are more valuable than your job title. They are the gold standard of recession-proof abilities in the workplace. The ability to adapt your current set of skills to unfamiliar situations will set you apart from the competition and make you an invaluable asset to your team.

2. **Soft Skills**

It has been said that technical competence and knowledge account for only 15% of your professional success. The term "soft skills" refers to a set of abilities that have nothing to do with technology but are nonetheless crucial to your success in the workplace. Some examples of such abilities are the capacity for effective communication and the ability to interact well with people.

Since you and your coworkers probably have similar technical talents and knowledge (after all, that's how you both obtained the job), you must have strong interpersonal abilities. Therefore, the interpersonal skills you possess will be your competitive edge. It doesn't matter what industry you're in or what job you have, having strong soft skills is essential.

Communication, negotiation, leadership, imagination, organization, efficiency, motivation, and networking are all examples of important soft skills. Are you a good negotiator who can represent your interests and those of your team? Do you have the communication skills to get things done? Do you have the ability to work alone and manage your time well?

The success of a team and the company as a whole depends on each of these factors, so managers prioritize them when hiring new staff.

3. **Technology Skills**

Being technologically literate is crucial in technology's competitive employment environment. Doing so in a time of economic hardship will demonstrate your worth to your current company and increase your marketability to future employers. Get acquainted with Slack, Asana, and Trello, some of the most popular tools for team communication and organization. Gain expertise in web development by studying code, working with a CMS, or developing new skills.

Along with these skills, you also need to develop a recession-proof career plan, and the following points may help you do that.

## Ways to Build a Recession-proof Career

The following are some of the most trusted ways to make your career a recession proof one:

- **Increase and enhance your academic qualifications:** One of the most effective strategies to advance in your chosen field is to further your education. In addition to enhancing your employability, taking a postgraduate course or obtaining a certification from a reputable institution (For e.g: Skillslash) will enrich your life by introducing you to interesting new people and providing you with insights into your personal goals and passions. Motivated individuals who are eager to take on new challenges are highly sought after by employers.
- **Be more involved in your community:** Strengthen your knowledge and connect with more people. Explore opportunities to connect with others while making a positive impact. Doing so can attest to your ability to work through challenges and persevere as part of a group. In addition, it can show prospective employers who you really are as a person.
- **Be adaptable to change:** Don't be afraid to make a career change if it means a more secure future for you. Jobs in the medical field, specialty care, therapy, counseling, law enforcement, public utility, IT, technology, and education are just a few examples.
- **Work on self-awareness:** Last but not least, always be cognizant of your environment and your capabilities and limitations. You can better appreciate your value to your employer if you have a firm grasp on who you are and what drives you. Keep abreast of current economic events, and remember the crucial roles that some occupations have in maintaining our society's well-being. However, take the initiative to search for a position that suits your needs.
